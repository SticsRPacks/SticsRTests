ABSTRACT

       JavaStics - The JavaStics Java application provides either a graphical
       user interface or a command line interface for the Stics Soil-Crop model;
       depending on the used launch method (see details below).
       
       JavaSticsCmd.exe can be used like any .jar in an Unix environment. 
       But it requires a version of Java virtual machine at least equal to 11. 

       Under Windows, JavaSticsCmd.exe use does not need to meet any requirement,
       because the Java virtual machine 11 is embedded in the .exe archive.

       See JavaStics documentation included in the JavaStics distribution

SYNOPSIS

              [WINDOWS]
       JavaSticsCmd.exe
       JavaSticsCmd.exe [OPTIONS]

              [UNIX]
       java -jar JavaSticsCmd.exe
       java -jar JavaSticsCmd.exe [OPTIONS]
	   
DESCRIPTION

       This help mainly relates how to use JavaStics from the 
       command line using options and arguments, for launching
       specific JavaStics actions with shell. JavaSticsCmd.exe must
       be launched from the JavaStics root directory.

       JavaSticsCmd.exe runs JavaStics Gui

       [WORKSPACE] is always expected : it may be either a 
       JavaStics workspace directory name or relative path inside 
       the JavaStics directory or a full absolute path to a 
       workspace directory

       [USM] is expected as the name of one USM; may be optional

OPTIONS
 
       -h, --help
            displays this help

       -v, --verbose
            put this anywhere in the command to run stics with full logs
            
       -d, --debug
            put this anywhere in the command to run stics with debug 
            logs
            
       -r, --run [WORKSPACE]
            run stics, WORKSPACE is used as JavaStics workspace,
            all USMs are executed in that workspace
            
       -r, --run [WORKSPACE] [USM1] [USM2] ...
            run stics, WORKSPACE is used as JavaStics workspace,
            and each USM name (one or a list of) is executed
            individually in that workspace

       --run-successive [WORKSPACE] [USM1] [USM2] ...
            run stics, WORKSPACE is used as JavaStics workspace,
            and a list of USM name (at least 2) is expected for
            executing them successively
            
       --generate-txt [WORKSPACE] [USM]
            generate Stics Fortran binary input files (text) from
            JavaStics files (XML), WORKSPACE is used as JavaStics
            workspace. This command only works using one USM name.
            
EXAMPLES

     All use case examples below are for using JavaStics command
     line under Windows and the "example" workspace included in
     the JavaStics distribution archive.
     They can be used "as is" from the command line inside
     the JavaStics folder.

     * Running successive USMs

            JavaSticsCmd.exe --run-successive example demo_Wheat1
            demo_BareSoil2 demo_maize3

     * Generating text files for Stics

ABSTRACT

       JavaStics - The JavaStics Java application provides either a graphical
       user interface or a command line interface for the Stics Soil-Crop model;
       depending on the used launch method (see details below).
       
       JavaSticsCmd.exe can be used like any .jar in an Unix environment. 
       But it requires a version of Java virtual machine at least equal to 11. 

       Under Windows, JavaSticsCmd.exe use does not need to meet any requirement,
       because the Java virtual machine 11 is embedded in the .exe archive.

       JavaStics - The JavaStics Java application provides either a graphical
       user interface or a command line interface for the Stics Soil-Crop model;
       depending on the used launch method (see details below).
       
       JavaSticsCmd.exe can be used like any .jar in an Unix environment. 
       But it requires a version of Java virtual machine at least equal to 11. 

       Under Windows, JavaSticsCmd.exe use does not need to meet any requirement,
       because the Java virtual machine 11 is embedded in the .exe archive.

       See JavaStics documentation included in the JavaStics distribution
       doc/JavaStics_documentation.html

SYNOPSIS

              [WINDOWS]
       JavaSticsCmd.exe
       JavaSticsCmd.exe [OPTIONS]

              [UNIX]
       java -jar JavaSticsCmd.exe
       java -jar JavaSticsCmd.exe [OPTIONS]
	   
DESCRIPTION

       This help mainly relates how to use JavaStics from the 
       command line using options and arguments, for launching
       specific JavaStics actions with shell. JavaSticsCmd.exe must
       be launched from the JavaStics root directory.

       JavaSticsCmd.exe runs JavaStics Gui

       [WORKSPACE] is always expected : it may be either a 
       JavaStics workspace directory name or relative path inside 
       the JavaStics directory or a full absolute path to a 
       workspace directory

       [USM] is expected as the name of one USM; may be optional

OPTIONS
 
       -h, --help
            displays this help

       -v, --verbose
            put this anywhere in the command to run stics with full logs
            
       -d, --debug
            put this anywhere in the command to run stics with debug 
            logs
            
       -r, --run [WORKSPACE]
            run stics, WORKSPACE is used as JavaStics workspace,
            all USMs are executed in that workspace
            
       -r, --run [WORKSPACE] [USM1] [USM2] ...
            run stics, WORKSPACE is used as JavaStics workspace,
            and each USM name (one or a list of) is executed
            individually in that workspace

       --run-successive [WORKSPACE] [USM1] [USM2] ...
            run stics, WORKSPACE is used as JavaStics workspace,
            and a list of USM name (at least 2) is expected for
            executing them successively
            
       --generate-txt [WORKSPACE] [USM]
            generate Stics Fortran binary input files (text) from
            JavaStics files (XML), WORKSPACE is used as JavaStics
            workspace. This command only works using one USM name.
            
EXAMPLES

     All use case examples below are for using JavaStics command
     line under Windows and the "example" workspace included in
     the JavaStics distribution archive.
     They can be used "as is" from the command line inside
     the JavaStics folder.

     * Running all USMs

            JavaSticsCmd.exe --run example

     * Running a single USM or a list of
   
            JavaSticsCmd.exe --run example soybean
            
            JavaSticsCmd.exe --run example wheat maize

     * Running successive USMs

            JavaSticsCmd.exe --run-successive example demo_Wheat1
            demo_BareSoil2 demo_maize3

     * Generating text files for Stics

            JavaSticsCmd.exe --generate-txt example wheat
